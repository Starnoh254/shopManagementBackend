# Enhanced Payment and Debt Tracking System

## üéØ Overview

The enhanced payment and debt tracking system provides comprehensive tracking of which specific debts are paid by each payment, calculates debt payment percentages, and maintains a complete audit trail of all payment allocations.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

### New Models

#### PaymentAllocation

Tracks which specific debts were paid by each payment:

```prisma
model PaymentAllocation {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  paymentId   Int
  payment     Payment @relation(fields: [paymentId], references: [id])
  debtId      Int
  debt        Debt    @relation(fields: [debtId], references: [id])
  amount      Float   // How much of this payment went to this debt
  allocatedAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### Updated Models

#### Debt Model

Now tracks original debt amount for percentage calculations:

```prisma
model Debt {
  // ...existing fields...
  amount          Float               // Current remaining amount
  originalAmount  Float               // Original debt amount (never changes)
  paymentAllocations PaymentAllocation[] // Track payments made to this debt
}
```

#### Payment Model

Enhanced with allocation tracking:

```prisma
model Payment {
  // ...existing fields...
  allocations     PaymentAllocation[] // Track which debts this payment covered
  creditTransactions CreditTransaction[] // Related credit transactions
}
```

## üöÄ How the Enhanced System Works

### 1. **Payment Process (FIFO - First In, First Out)**

When a customer makes a payment:

```javascript
// Example: Customer owes $150 (3 debts: $50, $60, $40) and pays $100

1. Get unpaid debts (oldest first)
   - Debt #1: $50 (Jan 1st)
   - Debt #2: $60 (Jan 5th)
   - Debt #3: $40 (Jan 10th)

2. Apply payment using FIFO:
   - $50 ‚Üí Debt #1 (fully paid)
   - $50 ‚Üí Debt #2 (partially paid, $10 remaining)
   - $0  ‚Üí Debt #3 (untouched)

3. Create payment allocations:
   - PaymentAllocation: paymentId=123, debtId=1, amount=$50
   - PaymentAllocation: paymentId=123, debtId=2, amount=$50

4. Update debt statuses:
   - Debt #1: isPaid=true, amount=$0
   - Debt #2: amount=$10 (was $60)
   - Debt #3: unchanged
```

### 2. **Debt Percentage Tracking**

Each debt tracks:

- **Original Amount**: Never changes (e.g., $60)
- **Current Amount**: Remaining balance (e.g., $10)
- **Total Paid**: Sum of all allocations (e.g., $50)
- **Percentage Paid**: (Total Paid / Original Amount) √ó 100 (e.g., 83.33%)

### 3. **Complete Audit Trail**

Every payment creates detailed records:

```javascript
{
  "payment": {
    "id": 123,
    "amount": 100,
    "allocations": [
      {
        "debtId": 1,
        "amount": 50,
        "debt": {
          "description": "Water bottles",
          "originalAmount": 50
        }
      },
      {
        "debtId": 2,
        "amount": 50,
        "debt": {
          "description": "Delivery service",
          "originalAmount": 60
        }
      }
    ]
