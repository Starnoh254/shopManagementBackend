# Simple Debt Management System for Small Businesses

## ï¿½ Problem Statement

This system replaces the **paper notebook** used by small vendors (water sellers, shops) to track customer debts. Key issues solved:

- âœ… **No more lost books** - All data is stored digitally
- âœ… **Chronological debt history** - Customers can see exactly when they took credit
- âœ… **Easy lookup** - Find any customer's debt history instantly
- âœ… **Automated reminders** - SMS notifications when debt reaches threshold

## ðŸ’¡ Core Features (MVP)

Your current system already has the essentials:

- âœ… User authentication (shop owner login)
- âœ… Customer management (add customers)
- âœ… Debt tracking (add debt, record payments)
- âœ… **Chronological transaction history** (most important feature!)
- âœ… SMS notifications
